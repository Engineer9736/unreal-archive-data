Rocket Arena is a special kind of deathmatch game designed by David 'CRT'
Wright.  There are no pickups, no items to manage.  You start with every
weapon, fully loaded with ammo.  There isn't any health, when you die you
lose.  The goal is to play the best you can play and to improve your raw
gaming ability at the same time.  You will play in small arenas against a
single opponent or with a partner against two opponents.  It's not going to
be easy, but if you work hard, you can prove to the world that you are the
best of the best. 

Good luck!
