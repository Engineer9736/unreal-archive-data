So what is Soccer Tournament then? Soccer Tournament is an exciting new 
gametype for Unreal Tournament. Unlike regular Tournament gametypes, no-one
gets killed, there are no pickups, and there's no easy way of winning. You 
must work with your team to score goals by kicking a soccer ball into a goal
area, and either get the most goals within the time limit or win by reaching
the goal limit.
