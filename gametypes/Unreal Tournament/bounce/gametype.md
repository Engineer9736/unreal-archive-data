Bounce is a mod pack of a set of gametypes which change the gameplay in a simple but effective way. Attacks from other players no longer
deal damage. But instead reduce your mass, causing you to become lighter. The goal of Bounce is to knock your opponents into the various
pools, pits, and other traps that litter the arenas. While avoiding being kicked into them yourself, in logical ways, like eating pizzas and
cookies to increase your weight. . . Madness? THIS IS UN-REAL.
