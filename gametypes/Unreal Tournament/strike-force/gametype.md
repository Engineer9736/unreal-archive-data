Strike Force is a modification for Unreal Tournamnet. This means you have to 
have the full UT game in order to run our FREE mod. Strike Force brings a real
world tactical sim to the UT engine. Strike Force puts terrorist against 
counter terrorist in real world environments. Strike Force has four varied 
game types, each with its own objectives. You can rescue hostages, escape 
from the enemy, work as a team in TDM or play fast and frantic DM. Each
character is specialized with his own weapon, health, speed and accuracy. 
You will also find that each team has its own weapons. We would like to welcome
you to the world of Strike Force!
