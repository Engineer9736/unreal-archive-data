The inspiration for this game is the movie [Scavenger Hunt](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079858/). Go rent it.

This is a team game which can be best summed up as an interesting mix between CTF and Domination. The level is strategically populated (by
the mapper) with flags of various point values: 50, 25, 10, and 5. Players search for these flags and bring them to their base to add the
points to their score.

The mapper can also place Black Flags. Black Flags are worth -50 points. You'll want to drop these babies into your enemies base. Black
Flags can be disabled from a game even though they may exist in a map.

If you kill an enemy with a flag they will drop it (of course) and you have a limited amount of time to pick it up again before it
disappears. The more important the flag is the shorter the time before it disappears.

After a flag is scored (or disappears after being dropped) it will wait for a bit of time before respawning again. The more important the
flag is the longer it will take to respawn. The team to first reach the score limit (or the team to have the highest score when the time
limit is reached) is the winner of the match.
