Smashdroids is a third person fighting game built using the Unreal Tournament Engine. In the game you play as one of the Smashdroids, a
ragtag group of junkyard robots. Players battle against each other in a series of matches. The game includes many new features not found in
regular Unreal Tournament.

**Third Person View and Aiming Style**

Smashdroids is played from a third person point of view. You can see your own character and rotate the camera around them to get a good view
of the action. To counteract the traditional difficulty of aiming from a third person perspective, all the characters fire at a level angle.
Also, if you get backed into a corner your player will become slightly transparent so you don't lose sight of the action.

**Single and Multiplayer Action**

Set up multiplayer servers and play against friends. Or start a botmatch and play against the computer. The bots can also play in your
multiplayer games.

**Eight New Characters**

Smashdroids includes eight completely new player characters. They are a motley crew of junkyard robots pieced together from spare parts.
Some are bizarre and some are just demented. Click on the Characters page for more info on the individual Smashdroids.

**Original New Weapons**

Instead of the traditional way of using weapons from Unreal Tournament, in Smashdroids each character has their own unique attacks that only
they can perform. Each character has a regular fire and altfire attack that unleash their powers. The weapons are individulized and reflect
the characters unique attributes.

**New Arenas to Battle In**

Smashdroids comes with several specially designed arenas for you to battle in. They are designed to be easily played in a third person view.
The arenas range from a rowdy robot-filled arena to a mining station on a comet hurling through space. Each level also has deadly traps that
spectators can operate to interfere with the match in progress.

**New Style of Gameplay**

The Smashdroids gameplay is a blend between third person action game and fighting game. Instead of just racking up frags, your goal is to be
the last robot alive and win the round. You gain 5 points for winning a match, 3 for tieing one, and 1 for every enemy Smashdroid you
destroy. Try to rack up as many points as you can. You set a time limit on how long each match lasts.

**Spectators Can Play Active Role in Matches**

You can join a game of Smashdroids as a spectator or end up as a spectator after you have been killed. Either way there is more to do than
just sit there and look around. In Smashdroids, spectators can affect the match by operating traps that only they can see around the level.
Examples are a laser turret that can be activated by spectators to shoot at players or giant saw blades that spectators can trigger into
action when other players unsuspectingly stumble near them. Now you have a chance to get back at the guy who knocked you out of the match,
even when you're dead!

**New HUD and User Interface**

Smashdroids comes with a brand new simplified HUD. It also comes with new, easy to use menus for choosing a character, switching levels,
joining a game, or launching a Smashdroids server.

**New Music**

Smashdroids has its own original music. The songs have a cool new take on the synthesized analog music of early video games.
