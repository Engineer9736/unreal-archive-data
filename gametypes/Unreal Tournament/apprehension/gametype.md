Have trouble deciding between Capture the Flag and Deathmatch? Ever wish you could run around your favorite DM map with a flag on your back?
Then this is your lucky day!

Apprehension takes your regular Team Deathmatch game and adds flags. But there are no bases, you say. Well of course not. Here's how it
works:

- The first player on each team to score a frag is given posession of their team's flag.
- The object is to take your flag and at least one enemy flag to a Scoring Bubble found floating randomly around the map. Touch the bubble
  and you score!
- When someone scores, or when a bubble finds itself stuck, the bubble will pop and reappear somewhere else.
- When you score, all the flags you're carrying - including your own team's flag - are removed from the game until the next time someone on
  each team scores a frag.F
