### YOUR MISSION

You are a crew member of Vortex Rikers2, which will get a signal from the planet (Na Pali). The message came from 3 survivors of the old
Vortex Rikers, the prisoner ship that crashed on the planet some months ago. Now you will be let down on the planet to rescue these 3
survivors. Unfortunately you were sniped down by a Skaarj right after you landed.

### New mission

Rescue your own ass. You are in a Skaarj prison, they destroyed all your equipement. You’ll have to try to get out of the prison and find
the old Vortex Rikers. If you are lucky it’s computers are still working and you can send a message to your mothership, so they can come
rescue you….

### Overview

Operation Na Pali is a huge campaign rivalling the size of Unreal, which was released in 2002 by David Münnich led Team Vortex - much to
critical acclaim. This pack sees the player return to Unreal's original diverse Na Pali setting pitted up against the traditional enemy
line-up, only this time you're armed with the Unreal Tournament arsenal, accompanied by a flashy new HUD, Nali and Mercenary allies and even
get to fly a Skaarj shuttle in a couple of levels. Additionally, ONP comes with a built in system for level designers to create their own
maps and campaigns using the custom gametype and features, launchable through the ONP menu by adding the "ONP-" prefix to the map name.
