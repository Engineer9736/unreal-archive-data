RealCTF is a capture-the-flag modification for Unreal. The primary focus of RealCTF is to merge the fast-paced
teamplay action of QuakeWorld CTF with the rich visuals of Unreal.

RealCTF includes three game types: RealDeathMatch, RealTeamGame, and RealCTF. RealDeathMatch and
RealTeamGame are similar to regular Unreal Deathmatch and TeamGame types, but with the gameplay
improvements of RealCTF including faster weapon switching, optional tractor beam and artifacts.
