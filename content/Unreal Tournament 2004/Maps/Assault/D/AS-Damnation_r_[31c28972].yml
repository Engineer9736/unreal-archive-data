description: "|\x06This scenario is a recreation of the attempt by Hellion forces\
  \ to destroy the vital Thermoelectric Dam on Fornacis.  The dam had already been\
  \ weakend by numerous erruptions and was a ripe target for the Hellions.  While\
  \ the generators themselves could be easily sabotaged, their loss would have been\
  \ easy to replace.  However, weaknesses in the dam exploited with properly placed\
  \ explosives could permenantly reduce the power source to rubble."
