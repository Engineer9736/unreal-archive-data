description: "The Ancient Mech had been destroyed, however, the platform that carried\
  \ the Mech carried something more sinister. The Renegade Power Node is capable of\
  \ disrupting weather patterns on a large scale. It could affectively hold the Earth\
  \ for ransom. No one is sure why the platform wasn't destroyed in the intial battle,\
  \ some say that the Power Node was activated at the last moment, destroying the\
  \ Earth forces and ripping away half the platform in the process. The Renegade Power\
  \ Controller must be destroyed."
