description: "After the failure of Area 51, it was demolished and moved onto a more\
  \ secure location. The most secure location affordable was the crashsite of the\
  \ Skaarj Mothership which is guarded by the different clans of Skaarj. The owners\
  \ of Area 52 'The Izanagi' thought the Skaarj would play a major part in defending\
  \ their ship."
