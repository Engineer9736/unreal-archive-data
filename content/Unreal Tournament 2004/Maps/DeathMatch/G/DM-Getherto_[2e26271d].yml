description: "C\bWhen Liandri corporation opened 'JAR-34' arena (Just Another Rankin\
  \ - 34th industrial in its possession), no one could expect that players would name\
  \ the arena on their own. Liandri chose an interesting man to make an arena keeper.\
  \ Merty Getherto, former gardener and sprayer, surely imprinted his individuality\
  \ to the face of the arena. Nobody calls it by other name but 'The Getherto'. And\
  \ he is also funny guy, really. Even Malcolm likes talking with him for a few minutes\
  \ before he enters another match to win."
