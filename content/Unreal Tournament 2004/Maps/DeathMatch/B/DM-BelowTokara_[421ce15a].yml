description: "Q\x06Set in the former drainage system for the Tokara Forest Arena.\
  \  Later refurbished to provide a practice arena for the Tokara Forest competitors.\
  \  After the Forest Arena became mostly destroyed from the constant tournaments,\
  \ the forest and practice arenas were left derelict.  Now, disused and slightly\
  \ run-down, the practice arena was recently re-acquired by Liandri and opened as\
  \ a tournament arena."
