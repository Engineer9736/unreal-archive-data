description: "Deep in the ocean of a distant planet, this extraction facility lies,\
  \ once mining a valuable liquid compound. It would transport this compound to the\
  \ ocean surface, holding it within a gravitational field, from which scientists\
  \ can take samples for checking the quality of the extraction process. The pocket\
  \ has recently been mined out and thus the facility has turned useless, with only\
  \ water being held in the gravity field."
