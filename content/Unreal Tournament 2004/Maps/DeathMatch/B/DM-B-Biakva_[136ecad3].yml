description: "This high tech installation is used to store huge amounts of energy.\
  \ But because way too much energy was generated and brought here the reactor was\
  \ overloaded and the whole place went down. Now the deserted place is sold to the\
  \ Liandri Corp. Make good use of the traps and pickups to gain the upper hand in\
