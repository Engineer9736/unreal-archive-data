description: "x\x04Another map for 0wnz0r Industries, this giant pyramid (of which\
  \ only the top is visible) would be a sensible deathmatch arena if not for one thing:\
  \ excessive wind. Laugh as your enemies are blown off the edge! Enjoy watching projectiles\
  \ curve entertainingly through the air! Especially good with BioRifle Arena."
