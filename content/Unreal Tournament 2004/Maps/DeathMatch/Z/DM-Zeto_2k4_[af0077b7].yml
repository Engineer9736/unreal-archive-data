description: "In the year of 2001 the zeto icestation was braught down and put together\
  \ again to serve as spacestation zeto. But in the year of 2005 the station became\
  \ uneffective and had to get cheeper to run, and the most expencive part on a spaceship\
  \ was  the heating of it, so the NASA decided to make it warm enough to live in\
  \ by using LAVA.. (thanx to Allan ``Talisman´´ Willard, original author of zeto"
