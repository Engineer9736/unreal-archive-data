description: "Lo, there do I see my father. Lo, there do I see my mother, my sisters\
  \ and my brothers. Lo there do I see the line of my people back to the beginning.\
  \ Lo, they do call to me. They bid me take my place in Asgard at the halls of Valhalla,\
  \ Where spirits of the Tru' may live forever. Lo, here do I see my son. Lo, here\
  \ do I see my daughter, their daughters and sons. Lo, here do I see the line of\
  \ my people forward to the mists of tomorrow. Lo, they do call to me. They bid me\
  \ take my place in Midgard at the hearth of our folk. Where the memories and spirits\
  \ of the family will live forever."
