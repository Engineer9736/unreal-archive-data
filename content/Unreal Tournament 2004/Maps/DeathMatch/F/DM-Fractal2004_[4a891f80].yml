description: "\\\x05The result of a public poll carried out by the Liandri-Rules-Board\
  \ was, that many of the Tournament-Fans wanted to see the old arenas again. So many\
  \ of them were brought back to life but the Fractal Reactor wasn't safe enough!||So\
  \ the Fractal Reactor #2 was built by Liandri to bring once again the Tournaments\
  \ to a really classic Deathmath-Arena!"
