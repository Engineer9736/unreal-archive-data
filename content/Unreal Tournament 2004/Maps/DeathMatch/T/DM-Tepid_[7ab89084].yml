description: "L\x06A haze inhabits these once abandoned corridors, inhabits the lungs,\
  \ the mind. A haze of dead and toxic gasses. Yet this arena is alive!! Alive with\
  \ the burning flesh and dried blood of carnage from hundreds and hundreds of casualties.\
  \ A bony finger of sunlight beckons through a skylight. But the exterior air is\
  \ even more noxious and impenetrable. Betrayed even by God. The fog is closing in..."
