description: "The haunt of the undead leader Mirkrall was where he'd hunt and mercilously\
  \ kill his foes. His lair became his tomb when  Ashlore, an intended victim, threw\
  \ him into a pool of lava, but still his soul haunts the den, and nods and grins\
  \ in approval of the wanton bloodshed of the tournament."
