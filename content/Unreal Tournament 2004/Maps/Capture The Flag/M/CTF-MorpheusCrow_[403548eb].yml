description: "[\x06LMC knew they had found an excellent arena at the very top of a\
  \ newly constructed Galaxyscraper Superstructure. Thanks to the modern miracle of\
  \ super tensile solids, these three buildings reach a staggering 12 miles high at\
  \ their pinnacle. The thin atmosphere and reduced influence of Earth's gravity provide\
  \ an interesting test of the Tournament athlete's ability to adapt and conquer in\
  \ extreme environments."
