description: "Welcome to OldSkoolHallz, a personal arena designed and created by Syphir\
  \ himself. Located in an unidentified area, this facility was built specifically\
  \ for the Unreal Tournament. This is no factory-turned killing zone, it was built\
  \ for what it does: kill.  With long corridors and no where to hide, OldSkoolHallz\
  \ is currently Syphir's best work yet!"
