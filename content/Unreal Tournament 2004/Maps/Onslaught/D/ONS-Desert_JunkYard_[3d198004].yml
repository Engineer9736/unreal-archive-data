description: "When the Skaarj attacked, they had to make it through this valley. It\
  \ was one of the humans last defense measures. It was an old abandoned junk-yard\
  \ were they set up a power core station. It was only accessable by air. If the humans\
  \ fail to hold this power core station, then it could be the end of the humans."
