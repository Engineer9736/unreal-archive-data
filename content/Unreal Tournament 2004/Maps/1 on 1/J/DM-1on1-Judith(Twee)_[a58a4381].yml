description: "D\x06The world knows this army base in the Canadian north as KJGD-783\
  \ or more commonly as the Judith Nuclear Bunker. This is the first place you want\
  \ to be when the next world war breaks loose, so thus it makes sense that it should\
  \ be \"stress\" tested before that day happens. To do that you and your fellow fighters\
  \ will get to do your worst to it, and in the process hopefully to each other."
