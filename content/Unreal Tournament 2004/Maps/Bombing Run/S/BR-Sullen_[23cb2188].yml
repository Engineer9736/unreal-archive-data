description: "Y\x04This is just a small arena BR map I made in an hour or so, just\
  \ as a test of a concept. It is made for people who like arena BR, and it is made\
  \ for people who like low-grav instagib. It does have pickups, but I reccommend\
  \ you play it as a low grav instagib map. Hope you enjoy it."
