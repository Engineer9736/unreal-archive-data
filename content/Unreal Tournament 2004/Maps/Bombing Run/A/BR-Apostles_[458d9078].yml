description: "The fog closes in, enemies attack from above, below, everywhere, either\
  \ go for the height advantage of the walkways or try and avoid enemies by using\
  \ the multiple ground routes. Be careful when shooting for from long range, missing\
  \ the goal results in the ball being luanched back towards the center of play, sometimes\
  \ not too far from the goal, sometimes a lot closer to your goal then you would\
  \ like it."
