description: "Each year, Winters cold hands close around the small mountain community\
  \ of Festive Ridge, blocking the roads with heavy snowfall. Nowhere else to go until\
  \ the weather clears, the people come down into the valley to celebrate the festive\
  \ season in their own unique way. If You can`t wait around for Santa, then take\
  \ a ride on the `autosleigh`... a gas powered jaunt to the other side of the valley.\
  \ And as it is Christmas, do not forget to give genorously, even if it is just rockets\
  \ that you rain down on the smiling faces below...  remember, it is the thought\
  \ that counts!"
