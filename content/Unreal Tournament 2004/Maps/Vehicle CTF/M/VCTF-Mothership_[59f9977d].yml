description: "Y\tFirst contact with the Skaarj came during the recovery of the prison\
  \ transporter Vortex Rikers on Na Pali. Within a year the Skaarj had pushed humanity\
  \ back to the brink of destruction. This scenario replicates the final battle for\
  \ Earth, and the stunning victory by humans in the face of almost certain defeat.\
  \ A Skaarj Mothership orbited the Earth, and rained death upon the planet in preparation\
  \ for the final landing. In a daring suicide mission, the humans attacked the Skaarj\
  \ Mothership in small one man fighters, hoping to exploit a flaw in the Mothership\
  \ defenses their analysis had revealed."
