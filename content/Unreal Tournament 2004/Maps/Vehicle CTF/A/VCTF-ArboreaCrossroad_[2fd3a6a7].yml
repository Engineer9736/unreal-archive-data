description: "The scientists could not believe their eyes when they discovered this\
  \ hidden valley surrounded by high mountains, a natural heaven unpolluted and unknown.\
  \ Unfortunately the secrecy did not last long and the Liandri Corporation did not\
  \ want to miss the opportunity to use this rediscovered and secluded place as a\
  \ testing ground for their new and deadly Tournament vehicle: The Aegis."
