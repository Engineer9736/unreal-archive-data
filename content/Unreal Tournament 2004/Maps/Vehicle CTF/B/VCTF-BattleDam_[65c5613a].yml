description: "This dam used to provide energy for the Liandri machine factories located\
  \ on the planet. But as manufacturing ceased, Liandri adapted it for the Tournament\
  \ instead. Where previously pristine water flowed through the turbines, it is now\
  \ tainted with the blood of fallen competitors."
