description: "A sunny tropical valley located on a resort planet. One day two enemy\
  \ Tournament teams happened to be there at the same time and bloodshead ensued.\
  \ Later on, the Tropik battleground was created to reenact that bloody battle. That\
  \ is how the story goes. The truth, however, is that the two top teams in the Tournament\
  \ did not meet there by accident. Instead it was the result of deliberate manipulation\
  \ by the Liandri Corporation, in order to affect the final outcome of the Tournament\
  \ itself."
